<td><p class="I4" id="I99">The Burj Khalifa known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Total height of Burj Khalifa is 829.8 m (2,722 ft) and a roof height is 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009.<br><br>The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai.At a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers experienced financial problems, and required more money and economic funding. Sheikh Khalifa, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence the changing of the name to "Burj Khalifa".<br><br> The concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around the landmark has proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.<br><br>There are unconfirmed reports of several planned height increases since its inception. Originally proposed as a virtual clone of the 560 m (1,837 ft) Grollo Tower proposal for Melbourne, Australia's Docklands waterfront development, the tower was redesigned by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.</p></td>
